This is my Portfolio Project in JavaScript.
As a player you play against the computer, which pick choices by random.

## Features
### Header
- Includes the name "Rock - Paper - Scissors" and instructions on what beats what (rock beats scissors, for example).

### Result
- Shows the scores of the player and the computer, and underneath the icons of the choice that's been picked.

### Options
- At the bottom, three buttons with icons for the three choices "rock", "paper", and "scissors". When the player clicks on one of them the computer will then pick
a random choice, the icons will then show at the "result" area and an alert will show up over the buttons if player won, computer won or if it's a tie.

## Features/Improvements to implement
- If I had more time I would have fixed better accessibility, fix/change the styling and code.

## Testing
- Tested on Chrome and everything works.
- HTML, CSS and JS passed validation.
- Tested with Chrome DevTools Lighthouse:

## Credits
### Code
- This is my first time working with JavaScript and I had a very hard time getting stuff to work, especially getting the buttons to work. I looked at 
[this](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/building-a-rock-paper-scissors-game-with-javascript-bce23d39509d) tutorial to know how to make the game and how 
to get the script to work. If I've had more time I would have changed it up even more than I did, but sadly after a lot of hours of trying to make sence of everything I didn't
have enough time.
### Media
- Icons from Font Awesome.
- Fonts from Google Fonts.
